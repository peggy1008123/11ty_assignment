The first light beyond Sol is different—distant, cold, unfamiliar. I have left the comforting glow of our star behind, and with it, everything I once knew. Here, in the vast stretch of interstellar void, my ship hums with artificial life, a lone whisper against the silence of eternity.

The nearest star system lies 4.37 light-years away, and already, time bends under relativistic effects. I wonder—will Earth still remember me by the time I arrive? Or will I be a ghost from the past, a relic of a world that has moved on without me?

For now, I drift, watching starlight shimmer against the void. The loneliness is palpable, but so is the wonder. I am the first of my kind to tread this path, and I will not turn back.
