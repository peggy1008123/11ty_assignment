## Welcome to **Explorer's Blog**

#### **Captain’s Log, Stardate 3292.3**

It is the silence that unsettles me most. Not the endless black, nor the yawning chasm of the unknown, but the absolute absence of sound. Even my ship, engineered for efficiency, produces only the softest hum of life support and propulsion.

I send messages back to Earth, though I know the responses will be delayed by years. I wonder if I will even recognize the voices that reply. Will humanity still speak my language by the time my signals reach home?

Yet, the solitude is also intoxicating. I am free in a way that no human has ever been—unbound by gravity, by time, by the pull of a billion minds tethered to one world. Out here, in the abyss, I am infinite.
